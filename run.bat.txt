this is about maven and git execution 
automated test cases done via eclipse is local execution within QA , once wrking fine 
make sure those test cases are executing remotely in CI environment , for that maven is used (Build tool)
later on jenkins 
we should be able to run our test cases through this POM.XML 
we can run the testing.xml file in POM.xml file by adding @1-dependencies (jar files req for project )
pom.xml is for adding dependencies only '
we can add @2-pluggins (compile and run the project)in POM.XML 2 kinds for outside of eclipse 
	Maven complier plugin- complie and running code 
	Maven SUREFIRE plugin - running our project 
	
From pom .xml give the suite name and run as Maven test 
build success 
dev team responsible 
Maven is a integrated software code is converted into package = build# dev
once our execution is done it will show build success 

install maven 
mvn -version we need to run in cmd after configuring the path of downloaded mvn version in environmental variables 
mvn cd path of project then give dir - will give location of files and xmls in project
then- ,mvn test to automatically run the pom.xml 
build success

2 commands - cd path , mvn test in cmd manually 
create one bat file to automatically skip the above steps 
go to project location in FM and create one .bat extension file as run.bat then open in notepad 
put cd C:\Users\abdul\eclipse-workspace\ECommerceProject 
			mvn test 
			
			inside run.bat file save and close 
			with single click in bat file everything will be done automatically '
			
we have to give the type of xml file we want to execute in pom.xml in suitexmfile  , we can also give multiple xml sure
 
 
 pom.xml > testng.xml > test cases > page object classes > utility files > test data > config files 
 
  pom.xml can run in eclipse , cmd , jenkins - ci tool
  
  QA  
  -----
  once devops is automated parallely qa will do same thing 
  end of day commit code from local repository to remote repository push

Devops team will take dev  team repository and create build and 2,run automation by taking our testing code  frrom github repository 
once its executed they will generate certificate happens through ni8 
mrng will be certified by devops and we will continue further testing 
continuous - nightly builds 

execution of sanity will be done at ni8 by devops team 


QA responsible for whatever changes are made in  wrkspace should be part of local repository(commit ) from there push into remote repository git hub - jenkins pulled inside 


jenkins will recieve latest code everyday from github repository
