this is about maven and git execution 
automated test cases done via eclipse is local execution within QA , once wrking fine 
make sure those test cases are executing remotely in CI environment , for that maven is used (Build tool)
later on jenkins 
we should be able to run our test cases through this POM.XML 
we can run the testing.xml file in POM.xml file by adding @1-dependencies (jar files req for project )
pom.xml is for adding dependencies only '
we can add @2-pluggins (compile and run the project)in POM.XML 2 kinds for outside of eclipse 
	Maven complier plugin- complie and running code 
	Maven SUREFIRE plugin - running our project
